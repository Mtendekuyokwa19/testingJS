# Test Driven Development Project 

## Short Description

This project is a composition of mini-tasks.
>
> 1. Calculator functions
> 1. Caeser cipher Algorithm
> 1. Reverse Array function
> 1. capitalizing Letter

### 1. Calculator functions

- Consists of mini function: `multiply`,`add`,`subtract`,`Divide`.
- These functions have been tested and all the tests passed
- The test help with proving that the function is bahaving like it supposed

### 2. Caeser cipher Algorithm

- This was used by julius caeser to pass secret meessages to his soldiers. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- The Code has mini-steps following the solid principle. The `movebyshiftkey` helps create the legend to use when making the encrypted word

- All the tests passed, and the mini steps where also tested

### 3. Reverse Array function

- An array is taken in and it flips it
- This one is simple hece it has the least steps

### 4. Capitalize function

- This function jut capitalizes the first letter.

## Technologies && Tools

## Installation

1. Clone the repo into your machine

    ```bash
        git clone git@githubcom:Mtendekuyokwa19/testingJS.git
     ```

2. Run npm install

```bash
npm install
```

3. Get Testing

```bash
cd src/tests/
npm test
```

## What I've Learned

- Test driven development is something I just heard form podcasts or saw in tweets, It was nice to have my skin in the game.

- The ThumbsUp for this method is that it makes me trust y functions more. Working with Jest also allowed me to easily debug.

- I see it as a method of developing pseudocode.
    Thinking about the outcode before writing the code really clears the mist of how the code should be implemented.
